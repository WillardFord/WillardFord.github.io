Hello! I am a Senior at UCSD researching pangenomic algorithms and applications under [Melissa Gymrek](https://gymreklab.com). I study both Bioinformatics and Probability & Statistics and am currently applying to computational biology PhD programs. 

I develop tools and  algorithms for large genomic and electronic health record datasets.

## Research interests
I'm broadly interested in problems that affect human health, especially biases in current genomics and biotech research. I envision a world where everyone recieves equivalently excellent medical care.

I previously developed population-scale algorithms for structural variant calling in long-reads data at the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org) under [Kiran Garimella](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/kiran-garimella). 

In 2023, I interned at the [Allen Institute for Brain Science](https://alleninstitute.org/division/brain-science/) where I implemented genomic deep learning models to predict cell-type specificity of targeting sequences in the motor cortex.
